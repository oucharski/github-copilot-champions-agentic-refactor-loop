# Example Prompts for the AI

Below are two sample tasks you can give to an AI assistant working on this repository.

---

## 1. Optimize `geometry.optimizedIntersect`

> **Prompt**  
> Rewrite the `optimizedIntersect` function in **src/geometry.js** so that it analytically computes the intersection of two 2â€‘D line segments in **O(1)** time, delivering the same results as `bruteForceIntersect`. 
> Always run the tests to check if the results are still the same, and performance is good enough.

## 2. Apply Style Guidelines

> **Prompt**  
> Refactor the codebase to comply with **docs/guidelines.md**.
